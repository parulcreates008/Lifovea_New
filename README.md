LiFovea— Adaptive Variable-Resolution 2.5D Lidar Mapping System
A perception stack that turns raw spinning-lidar point clouds into a foveated 2.5D map: 5 cm cells inside the braking distance, 80 cm cells at the horizon, with semantics, elevation uncertainty and traversability on every cell.

Built for the DRDO problem statement "Adaptive Variable Resolution 2.5D Lidar Mapping for Dynamic Environment Perception" (Smart Vehicles).

Quick start

pip install -r requirements.txt          # numpy is the only hard requirement
python -m avr25d.cli demo                # run the pipeline, print per-frame stats
python -m avr25d.cli serve --open        # interactive dashboard on :8080
python -m avr25d.cli bench --frames 20 --report BENCHMARK.md
python -m unittest discover -s tests     # 44 tests, ~12 s
Deploy as a web service

The included Dockerfile runs the dashboard on the port supplied by the host:

docker build -t lifovea .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 lifovea
For Render, create a new Blueprint from this repository. Render will read render.yaml, build the container, and provide a public URL. The /healthz endpoint is used for service health checks. The hosted dashboard uses the bundled simulator and does not require LiDAR hardware.
No dataset download and no annotation: the built-in simulator ray-casts a 64-beam lidar through a procedural urban scene and hands back exact per-point ground truth, which is what makes every number above a measurement rather than an estimate.

To train the network (≈100 s on CPU):

python -m avr25d.cli train --epochs 14   # writes checkpoints/avr25d.pt
Real-world fine-tuning

The trainer also accepts labeled real-world scans exported as .npz files. Each archive must contain xyz with shape (N, 3) and integer label with shape (N,), using the four project classes 0..3; intensity is optional. Pass a file or directory of scans for mixed simulator + real training, and a separate held-out directory for validation:

python -m avr25d.cli train --real-data data/real/train \
  --real-val-data data/real/val --epochs 14
The simulator remains in the training mix by default, preserving controlled coverage for rare cases while real scans improve sensor and scene realism.

Without a checkpoint the stack falls back to a deterministic geometric segmenter and keeps running — 91.7 % accuracy instead of 95.4 %.

The problem, and why the obvious answers fail

A 3D point cloud at 10 Hz is ~60 k points per revolution and millions per second. Two standard responses both lose:

Keep the full 3D cloud. A dense 5 cm voxel volume over a 100 m radius and 20 m of height is 800 MB of occupancy bits before you store anything useful in a cell. It does not fit in a vehicle's cache hierarchy, let alone its latency budget.
Flatten to a 2D occupancy grid. Now a 16 cm curb and a 5 m wall are the same symbol, a pothole is invisible, and a gantry 4.6 m overhead blocks the road it spans.
The third answer is to spend resolution where it buys safety. A vehicle at 15 m/s needs centimetres under its wheels and metres at the horizon — the same trade a retina makes. That is this project.

The variable-resolution grid

Powers of two, or nothing

Level L has cell size base_cell · 2^L — 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 cm. This is not cosmetic. It makes the map a strict quadtree: a level-L cell is exactly four level-(L−1) cells, so every boundary at a coarse level is also a boundary at every finer one. Two properties follow for free, and the problem statement asks for both:

No alignment error. There is no resampling step between resolutions, so there is nowhere for a half-cell offset to appear.
No data loss at a ring boundary.
Level is a property of the cell, not the point

The naive scheme — assign each point a resolution from its own range — breaks exactly at the ring boundaries. Two points 1 cm apart, straddling r = 10 m, land in different grids and the cell that contains both is split between two representations.

So the test is applied to the nearest corner of the candidate cell:

d_min(c) = distance from the sensor to the closest corner of cell c
leaf(x) = the coarsest level L such that d_min(cell_L(x)) ≥ R_L,
          descending from L_max, falling back to level 0
d_min is a property of the cell, so every point inside a cell resolves to the same level, and a cell that straddles a ring boundary refines to the finer level rather than being cut in half. Conservative in the safe direction, and exact.

tests/test_grid.py::test_level_is_a_property_of_the_cell_not_the_point verifies this by jittering 12 000 samples anywhere inside their own leaf — half of them deliberately placed on the ring boundaries — and asserting the level never changes.

The map moves with the vehicle

The grid is anchored to the world, not the sensor, so elevation estimates persist as the vehicle drives. But a cell's correct level changes as the range to it changes, so every frame rebalance() migrates cells:

Coarsening (cell falls behind): four children fuse by inverse-variance weighting — information-preserving, 1/σ² = Σ 1/σᵢ².
Refinement (cell comes into the near field): the parent seeds all four children and each child's variance is inflated by the parent's own vertical spread, because a parent genuinely does not know how its children differ.
test_migration_conserves_the_surface asserts the mapped elevation does not move when cells migrate.

What a cell holds

48 bytes: elevation, variance, ground z-extent, intensity, observation count, four-class evidence, overhead clearance, last-seen frame.

Elevation fusion

A scalar Kalman filter per cell, with a range-dependent measurement model:

σ_z(d)  = σ₀ + σ_rel · d                    (sensor noise grows with range)
R       = σ_z² + γ · var_in_cell            (a coarse cell really does contain
                                             more height variation)
R      /= n_ground                          (averaging helps)
K       = P⁻ / (P⁻ + R)
z⁺      = z⁻ + K (z_meas − z⁻)
P⁺      = (1 − K) P⁻ ,  P⁻ = P + q
The γ · var_in_cell term is what stops a 80 cm cell from claiming millimetre precision for ground it has averaged over.

Perception

Feature stage (shared by both backends)

13 per-point features from a voxel hash — no neighbour search, all bincount and reduceat, ~16 ms for 59 k points: height above the column minimum, column span, local density, the three eigenvalue shape descriptors (linearity, planarity, scattering) from per-voxel covariance, surface normal verticality, roughness, range and intensity.

pointnet2lite (default)

PointNet++ in the shape that matters: shared point-wise MLPs, symmetric max-pooling inside local neighbourhoods, two scales (0.6 m and 2.4 m), a global descriptor, and feature propagation back to every point. Neighbourhoods come from a voxel hash rather than farthest-point sampling + ball query — the same grouping semantics, deterministic, O(N), and no custom CUDA kernel to ship. 168 k parameters.

sparsevoxel

The sparse-convolution alternative: pillar encoder → scatter into a BEV feature map → dilated 2D CNN → gather back onto points. This is the backbone that sees context — a flat patch surrounded by road is road, the same patch surrounded by wall is a pavement.

geometric (the fallback)

Pure NumPy, no checkpoint, fully deterministic: lower-envelope ground surface, in-cell relief and slope for the terrain split, BEV connected components with shape priors for the dynamic/static split. It exists so the pipeline degrades instead of failing when PyTorch or a GPU is missing, and it is a real classifier: 91.7 % end to end.

Training

Supervision is free because the simulator knows the answer. Six procedural worlds for training, two unseen worlds for validation, ~100 s on CPU.

From map to decision

Terrain analysis is two different questions

Is this patch flat? is local, and the point network answers it. Is this patch drivable? is not: a sidewalk is perfectly flat, and it is not drivable because a 16 cm curb stands between it and the vehicle. That is a connectivity question about the map, and only the map can answer it.

So reachability runs on a navigation layer: the variable-resolution map aggregated into uniform 0.8 m tiles carrying representative elevation, internal relief (which is what a curb looks like once you stop resolving it), and whether anything solid intrudes below the vehicle's roof. A few thousand nodes instead of a hundred thousand, and — crucially — tiles large enough to be connected. At 5 cm a single revolution leaves the ground as disconnected islands and any reachability test returns "nowhere".

Three details earn their place:

Links probe across the radial sampling gap. A spinning lidar samples densely in azimuth and sparsely in range, so strict 4-adjacency fails at 30 m. Tiles link to the first observed tile in each direction.
Connectivity is only asserted across short links. A curb crossed obliquely over 3 m of unobserved ground looks like a 2° ramp. Links longer than two tiles inform slope but never grant reachability.
Past the horizon, "not reached" means "not known". Outside ~45 m the sampling no longer supports a connectivity verdict, so the map declines to give one instead of guessing. The grid may only ever revoke a point's drivability, never grant it — demotion is the safe direction, and it is the only direction the pipeline allows (test_grid_refinement_only_revokes_drivability).
Height decides, not footprint

A gantry at 4.6 m and a wall paint the same footprint in plan view. Here an obstacle blocks a tile only if part of it hangs below the vehicle's clearance above that tile's own ground. Everything else goes into the overhead-clearance layer, and the road underneath stays drivable. This is the single clearest thing 2.5D buys over 2D.

Planning

A* over the navigation tiles: arc length scaled by tile roughness plus an explicit climb penalty, refusing any edge above the platform's step height. The planner is the honest test of the map — if the traversability layer is wrong, the route drives over a curb. python -m avr25d.cli plan --ahead 40.

Results

20 frames, seed 7, torch:pointnet2lite, 2 vCPU. Reproduce with python -m avr25d.cli bench --frames 20 --report BENCHMARK.md.

Semantic accuracy

class	IoU	recall	precision
drivable	0.905	0.909	0.996
rough terrain	0.885	0.992	0.891
static obstacle	0.970	0.992	0.977
dynamic object	0.548	0.582	0.904
overall	mIoU 0.827	acc 0.954	
Network-only output is 96.4 % / 0.840 mIoU; the map's demote-only refinement trades 1 point of raw accuracy for the guarantee that nothing is called drivable that the vehicle cannot actually reach.

By range

band	points	accuracy	mIoU
0–10 m	822 872	0.953	0.840
10–20 m	186 864	0.973	0.700
20–40 m	38 342	0.884	0.709
40–70 m	9 379	0.908	0.796
70–100 m	3 270	0.926	0.695
Accuracy holds at range because obstacles stay separable; what degrades is the terrain split, which needs resolution the far field no longer has — which is the design working as intended, not in spite of itself.

Elevation error against analytic ground truth

band	median cell	MAE	P95 abs
0–10 m	5 cm	4.3 mm	10 mm
10–20 m	10 cm	5.6 mm	22 mm
20–40 m	20 cm	9.3 mm	38 mm
40–70 m	40 cm	42 mm	77 mm
70–100 m	80 cm	54 mm	147 mm
This is the whole trade in one table: millimetres where the wheels are about to be, decimetres at the horizon, for a map two orders of magnitude smaller.

Memory

representation	size	ratio
adaptive 2.5D map (165 k cells)	9.9 MB	1×
uniform 5 cm 2.5D grid	960 MB	97×
dense 5 cm × 20 m voxel occupancy (bits only)	800 MB	81×
uniform 80 cm grid (and no curbs, no potholes)	3.8 MB	0.4×
The last row is the honest comparison: a coarse uniform grid is smaller. It also cannot see a curb. The point of the adaptive grid is that it costs about 2.5× a useless map and 1 % of a usable uniform one.

Latency

stage	mean ms	p95 ms
features	16.1	17.5
segmentation	118.4	130.1
projection + fusion	56.5	66.4
traversability	38.8	48.8
total	229.8	259.1
4.4 fps on two CPU cores with no GPU and no batching. Segmentation is half the budget and is the only stage that is GPU-bound; the map itself runs at ~9 fps on this hardware, and the geometric backend gives 5.7 fps end to end today.

Structural integrity

invariant	measured	required
points resolving to exactly one leaf	100 %	100 %
leaf level matches lookup	100 %	100 %
cells stored at two levels	0	0
cells inside the wrong ring	0	0
projection alignment error	0 m	0 m
Dashboard

python -m avr25d.cli serve --open runs a survey-chart style dashboard that re-derives the grid in the browser from the classified point cloud — so the resolution-schedule sliders rebuild the map live rather than paging through pre-rendered images. Layers: elevation (hypsometric), semantics, traversability, cell size, in-cell relief. Click the plot to plan a route. The same page is what gets published as a shareable artifact.

Limitations, honestly

Pedestrian recall is 0.58. Legs occupy the same 20 cm of height as the road they stand on; without temporal association the network cannot always separate them. Instance tracking across frames is the fix and is not here.
Ego pose is taken as known. The simulator supplies it. On a real vehicle this is odometry or a scan-matcher, and the map's persistence is only as good as that pose.
Single sensor, no calibration story. Multi-lidar extrinsics and motion-distortion (deskew) compensation are not implemented.
Foveated inference is currently a no-op. The knob exists (ModelConfig.far_stride), but 78 % of returns from this sensor geometry fall inside 25 m, so subsampling the far field saves nothing. It would pay for a longer-range sensor.
The simulator is a simulator. It models range noise, dropout, occlusion and beam geometry; it does not model rain, dust, retro-reflectors or multi-path. Numbers here are not KITTI numbers, and the loaders for real data are not written.
